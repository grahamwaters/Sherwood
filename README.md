# Sherwood

The goal for Sherwood is to create as simple a trading bot as possible. This being said, there are certain aspects of trading that make the usage of a bot complex. The following is a list of some of the more complex aspects of trading with a bot.
* signals
* credentials
* browser automation
* dev accounts and trading fees

So, in our functions.py file, we will define functions that meet the following criteria:
* are simple (have no more than two arguments)
* perform a single action
